Slow day at work. Listening to the new Taylor Swift album and I just got done putting togeter this whole website. 

I think it is mostly good. There still might be some "template" stuff around and some of the links might be broken still. But the basic functionality is there are it seems to work pretty good. I like the layout but I wish it had or was a dark theme. I might look into that later or update the css to make it dark. I also need to edit my logo so it is a circle, I was just too lazy to remote into the other computer to edit it in photoshop. I tried to do it in paint but that wasn't happening. Also, need to remove the "Typography" link/page from the header. I moved that into the first references notes post.

More to come, maybe.
