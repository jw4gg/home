<h3>1:24pm</h3>

I've been swamped at work getting a contract renewed and attending meetings regarding that. I did finally get it awarded though which was good, although it added a good amount of micromanagement along with it. Thats ok. The Stars have been playing great in the Stanley Cup playoffs so I've been watching a ton of that. It is nice having the games so early in the afternoon. Have a game at 2pm today which if the Stars win they'll be off to the Semi Finals. Should be a good one. I've also been playing a lot of Truck sim in my freetime, that has been a good time. Been playing the new states that have come out and have been liking Texas. Need to get up to Montana and Kansas though, haven't been up there much. Haven't even though about remaking this website. Maybe one day I'll get around to it. Off to have a beer and get ready to watch the Stars win this game.
