![alt text]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/DSC05334-Edit.jpg "Profile Picture"){:.profile}

This is my about me page on my blog site. It is pretty cool. I have include my "very" professional profile photo with a photoshopped backdrop. I spend about 5 minutes making that photo so I am very proud of how it turned out.

I might add more to this about me page later on but probably not. I have to make the rest of this site.
